In test 1 there's a usual program in python that counts from 1 to 1000 changing multiples of 3, 5 and 15 for different words.
As it is an easy program it should run in almost any version of python, though I would advise 2.7 or last version.
Run under command:    python trial1.py


In minimal-test2 we have a minimal webapp that connects to the API https://pokeapi.co/ and displays all the starter mons. 
It's just a minimal version so it's easy to check the code in the API part.
As it is a really simple webapp we won't need to open a server or a framework like Django, just open index.html with your favourite browser (other than IE) and enjoy.
Make sure your internet connection is fine, otherwise it won't connect to the API.



In test2 we have a more developed version of the minimal-test2 SPA .
It has the same required functionality but adding some features and styling, such as a little quizz and modified an old AI program I had and added it to the mix.
As it is still a really simple SPA webapp we won't need to open a server or a framework like Django, just open index.html with your favourite browser and enjoy.
Make sure your internet connection is fine, otherwise it won't connect to the API.
You can also view the page in https://xebind.github.io/, where it will be hosted for some time.
